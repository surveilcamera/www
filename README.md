The term "surveil camera" seems to be a truncation or simplification of the concept of a surveillance camera or system. In its basic form, surveillance means to watch over or monitor activities, behaviors, or other changing information for the purpose of managing, influencing, directing, or protecting people. Thus, a "surveil camera" can be interpreted as follows:

1. **Surveillance Camera:** Cameras specifically designed for the surveillance of areas to enhance security, monitor behavior, and detect and prevent crime. These cameras can be a part of a larger surveillance system, which might include multiple cameras, recording devices, and even live monitoring capabilities. 

2. **Purpose:** A "surveil camera" implies a tool or device used for this kind of continuous observation, especially in contexts where security and monitoring are critical. This could include places like retail stores, public spaces, private properties, and high-security areas.

3. **Functionality:** Such cameras typically offer features beyond simple video recording, including motion detection, night vision, remote access via the internet, and sometimes even object recognition or event detection as advanced functionalities.

In short, "surveil camera" succinctly refers to the use and purpose of surveillance cameras, emphasizing their role in observation, security, and information gathering.
